TestSR7270
==========

A simple program for testing a Signal Recovery 7270 Lockin.  

The main.cpp file calls an instance of the main class and window which is defined in testsr7270.  A small class, SR7270 is used to represent the lockin.  The IP address and the port of the lockin are set on the front panel, and then the user can enter a command, send it to the lockin, and read the result.
